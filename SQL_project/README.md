# Unveiling the Hidden Scars of War: A Data-Driven Analysis of Armed Conflict and Suicide Rates

## Overview

War leaves indelible marks on societies, extending far beyond the battlefield. This project explores the harrowing connections between **armed conflict** and **suicide rates** through data-driven analysis using SQL.

**Key Objectives:**

- **Global Trends:** Analyzing two datasets â€“ one on global armed conflict from UCDP and another on suicide rates (1985-2016) from Kaggle.
- **Stratified Analysis:** Examining how armed conflict affects different populations based on **generation** and **sex**.
- **Intensity Correlation:** Investigating how suicide rates correlate with the **intensity** of armed conflict, shedding light on the broader societal impacts of war.

## Relevance and Timeliness

Amidst ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and potential escalations in Asia, understanding war's impact on civilians is crucial. This project aims to:

- Illuminate the often overlooked connection between armed conflict and suicide rates.
- Foster informed dialogue and action.
- Contribute to a deeper understanding of war's far-reaching consequences.
