### While typically performing Levenshtein distance calculations wouldn't occur directly within a SQL environment, we'll be employing it here for pedagogical purposes due to the nature of this SQL project. We'll utilize a dedicated function developed by Joseph Gama to achieve this. To ensure comprehensive understanding, we'll dissect this function momentarily, examining each component and its contribution to the overall operation. However, it's important to note that Levenshtein distance is generally better suited for scripting environments like Python, as you'll witness in another example within the portfolio repository's Python project.
