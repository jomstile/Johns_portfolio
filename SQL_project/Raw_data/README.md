## Diving into the Data :

While both datasets offer a ton of information, not all of it aligns with our specific question. To ensure a focused analysis, I will be cleaning this data and transforming into something that can be used.

### 1. Seeking Shared Shores :

Imagine our datasets as sprawling continents. We'll begin by pinpointing the countries that reside on both maps, establishing a common ground for meaningful comparisons.

### 2. Forging Foreign Key Bridges :

We'll add foreign key's into the data set to make the code easier to read, then we will join by both key and year.

### 3. Reshaping the UCDP date range :

The UCDP data's year ranges need reshaping. We'll transform those range of years into individual years, offering a more granular view and simplifying comparisons.

### 4. A Clearer Picture for Suicide Rates :

To eliminate potential distractions and ensure consistency, we'll remove countries within the Suicide Rates dataset that haven't experienced documented conflict. This clairifies our analysis and prevents misleading conclusions.
